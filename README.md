# game-tracker

The game tracker web app gives users access to a diverse library of video games by integrating access to the IGDB API which allows users to search over 250,000 unique video games and their video game information. Users can create an account, construct lists of games, follow other users, and rate video games. Once video games are marked as an interests, a user-specific engine recommends other video games of the same genre to the users. The goal of this project was to allow gamers to track video games, explore new games and connect to other gamers.
